               <p>
                  Table top role playing games, more often known as TTRPGs, have gained a massive surge of notoriety and attention in recent years, largly due to many celebrities, voice actors, and influencers producing shows and content revolving around them.

               <h2>Where to Start</h2>
               <p>
                  So you have seen these shows and decide you want to play as well, but not sure how to get started? It really is as simple as getting a book of rules of your prefered game, and finding someone who wants to play with you. There's no wrong way to play a TTRPG with your friends, as long as everyones having fun. But which game should you get? If there's a movie, show, or genre you love, there's probably a game for it. The most common one people try first, however, is Dungeons & Dragons.

               <h2>D&D, Often the Standard</h2>
               
               <p>Dungeons and Dragons has been around since the 70's, and after 50+ years and 5 different itterations has become the most well known TTRPG on the market, even spawning its own video games and movies. What makes it a decent start, is that it has a really good rule structure already in place for new players, and makes for a really good battle simulator so it's easy to digest your role. It also allows for variations on the rules to be easily implemented by more experienced players, and since it's got one of the largest player bases its fairly easy to find other people to play with.

               <h2>Other TTRPG's</h2>
               <p>
                  Dungeons & Dragons is a tried and true entry point into the world of role playing games, but there are TONS of different options on the market. While D&D makes for a really good fantasy battle game, some people seeing shows like Critical Role might be more interested in the actual ROLE PLAYING part of the game, and there are many games that are perfect for that. Do you want a rules light game in a sci fi game? There's a Star Wars or Dune RPG. How about playing a role in a japanese samurai drama? Then Legend of the Five Rings is the game for you!
